  'spellbook' : 'Contains a few basic spells for a novice wizard such as yourself. "Fire" allows you to ignite a small flame in your fingers, as though you had lit a match. Magical fire can set things ablaze without fuel, though it does not spread instantly.

"Magic Missile" is an offensive spell that lobs a small bolt of magical force at a target, dealing 2-5 points of damage on a hit. This never misses.'
